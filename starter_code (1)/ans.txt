1) yes
2) movl	$7777, -8(%rbp) : this statment suggests that the value of a is calculated before runtime.
3) no
4) movl	$7777, -8(%rbp)
	movl	-8(%rbp), %eax
	subl	$2222, %eax
    These three statements suggest that value is not propogated to the next statements or neither pre-calculated during calculated instead they will be substitued during runtime.


Part 2

1) yes
2) 	movl	$7777, %edx :this statment suggests that the value of a is calculated during compile time.
3) yes
4) 	movl	$5555, %ecx : this statement suggest that the value of a is propogated and b is calculated during compile time rather than runtime.
